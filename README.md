# Project 2

## Description

Project Repository:

 https://github.com/princessjenn/Project-2.git

Deployed HEROKU application:

 https://project-2-fullstack.herokuapp.com/

My team has conceived and executed a design that solves a real-world problem. We are required to creat our first collaborative full-stack application, while combining a robust back-end with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—to an intuitive front end.

My project group used everything have learned over the past fourteen modules of our bootcamp to create a full-stack application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge. In this second project, we demonstrate our problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see when we begin to interview for development roles.

OUR PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
